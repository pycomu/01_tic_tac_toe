#Tic-Tac-Toe by Christian Thompson
#Using Loops & Functions & Lists

#STAGE I:
#Create the main loop
#Print the board
#Create your loop
#Get the user input
#Put the user input in the board 

#STAGE II:
#Check for player win (8 Possibilities)

#STAGE III:
#Create the second player (NOT THE COMPUTER)
#Check for the second player win (8 Possibilities)
#Check for a full board (TIE)

#STAGE IV:
#Combine Stages II & III into 1 Function
#def is_winner(board, player):
#Create a function to check if the board is full
#def is_board_full(board)

#STAGE V:
#Creating our game AI
#def get_computer_move(board, player):
#i) Return random number
#ii) Make sure the random number is for an empty spot
